- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lucas Gay. I am studying computer science at Northeastern University with an interest in the intersection of technology and finance.
  I'm particularly interested in the quantitative finance space. I have built several experimental models using mathematics to predict volatility and price action.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about financial engineering to contextualize my computer science knowledge in a quantitative setting.
